1. Create a trial BLOB storage account
  1.1 Go to link: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0044p/> to register/create a free trial account
  1.2 After registration, go to storage account to add a new storage account, select "BlobStorage" as the type. I chose **local redundant** as the *Type*, other settings are kept as default

2. Upload scripts and dataset to the BLOB storage
* Go to the created storage account, Create a **Container**, where the pig scripts and dataset csv are uploaded to. NB! Container name can be only with lowercase
* Upload the script and the csv dataset to the created container
